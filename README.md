Dotrc
=====

Dotrc is a collection of GNU/Linux applications' configuration files documented
and pre-tuned for you.


Motivations
-----------

Each time you reinstall your favourite operating system _GNU/Linux_,
whether it is on a new machine or when you change to another distro, it is
always a pain to edit again all your favourite applications' configuration
files.

Dotrc is a collection of configuration files to help you quickly tune your
applications and bring them to their best. All the config files are documented
and set with our favourite settings. Hoping you enjoy the default settings!
Else do not worry, we tried to document them so it won't take you long to
make your applications behave the way you want.

Later on, we plan to add a tool to backup and restore all your configuration
files to make the reinstallation of your system smoother.

Note
----

Some configuration files start with a ".", so don't forget to show hidden files
when you look for the configuration file of an application.
